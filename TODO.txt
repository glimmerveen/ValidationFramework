FIXES
 . Fix calls to setVisible() on icon decoration
 . Check CellIconBooleanFeedback when sorting table
 . Icon tip decoration a bit more on the up and right when using Nimbus LAF
 . Fix moving panels on Linux when using the icon decoration on the tabbed pane
 . Remaining icontip's tooltips when quickly moving the mouse (in tables and outside tables): only on Linux?
 . Icon decoration steals mouse event even outside clipping bounds

NEW STUFF
 . Consistent comments (use of dispose(), cast transformers, default behaviors, what classes can be used for, etc.)
 . Allow disabled decoration on tab?
 . Allow disabled decoration on cell?
 . Table model change trigger
 . Table editing started/stopped/canceled triggers
 . Table checkbox editor trigger
 . Table editing: with/without valid commit to model, column-wise validator, per-cell/per-row group validation
 . More consistency for handling "no result" results
 . Initial state/trigger when building the validators
 . Fix ToolTipDialog transparency support (Java 6, Java 7 and JNA)
 . Label boolean feedback
 . Mappable validator builder
 . Manual trigger or trigger() method on the validator? How about the mappable validator?
 . Common settings (default icons, etc.)
 . Rule-based formatter
 . Reformat/Revert JFormattedTextField when focus lost? Save values allowed by the rules (wider than the default number formatter)
 . Icon decoration above combobox popups
 . JavaFX 2 support
 . Tab decoration depending on tab selection
 . No decoration on disabled components (config + listen to component state)
 . Avoid instantiation of result collectors (collect directly from validators, etc.)
 . Better icon tip anchoring for IconTipDecorator
 . Alternative location of icon tip w.r.t. screen edge
 . Common implementation for the icon tip
 . Auto-scroll/jump to errors in case of scrollpanes, tabbedpane, etc.
 . Initial focus for JFormattedTextField helper

THINK ABOUT
 . Remove data provider marker interface (check validation of heterogeneous groups first)
 . Property data provider
 . Check licenses again
 . Validation flow logging
 . Use of IDs
 . Use of predicates or compose heterogeneous rules or component state conditional rule or RuleTransformerWrapper/DataProviderTransformerWrapper
 . Aggregate boolean result collectors
 . Aggregate data from multiple providers, aggregate rule results
 . Validator marker interface?
 . Heterogeneous Group
 . Put decoration per plane and not per parent
 . Exception-based results
 . Conditional logic framework
 . All features described in the README file
 . Dialog strategies
